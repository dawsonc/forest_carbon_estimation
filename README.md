# Forest Carbon Estimation ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸ’¨

This repository contains code for estimating the above-ground biomass carbon in forests, using a database that identifies the linear regression parameters for the biomass according the tree's taxa, group, and specific gravity.

## Installation

This project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management. You can install poetry with the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). To install this package and its dependencies, and initialize the development environment, run

```
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install  # only needed for development
```

Poetry will create and manage a virtual environment for you, and it puts all of the dependency management under version control, (hopefully) leading to a more consistent install/development experience across team members.

To run a command in the poetry virtual environment, either run the command with poetry

```
poetry run <your command>  # e.g. poetry run python hello_world.py
```

or start a shell with the poetry environment activated

```
poetry shell
```

## Developing

This project uses [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and auto-formatting, `mypy` for type checking, and `pre-commit` for running code quality checks when you commit code.

## Files

- `/example_data`:
    - This folder contains generated data samples on 10, 100, and 1000 trees.
    - The data for each tree include:
        - `dbh`: this stands for the diameter at breast height, which is 4.5 feet above the ground
        - `species`: in our sample data, the species we include are `Ash`, `Maple`, `Oaks`, and `Pine, lodgepole`
        - `x_pos`
        - `y_pos`
- `/scripts`:
    - `generate_test_data.py`: this is the script used to generate the data in `/example_data`
- `/forest_carbon`:
    - This folder includes the models that we developed to estimate the biomass of individual trees
    - `/data`: this includes data on different species of trees, such as wood specific gravity, which we use to determine parameters to our model
    - `agb_biomass.py`: this file contains functions for calculating the above-ground biomass (AGB) of individual trees using a linear regression model with arguments based on the tree's species, DBH, and other parameters.
    - `combined_agb_calculator.py`: this script combines multiple AGB calculation methods and provides a unified interface to estimate the biomass of trees using different models based on what information is known about the tree.
    - `single_tree_estimation.py`: this script is another method for estimating the biomass of a single tree, which uses different parameters for an exponential model.
    - `tree_preprocessing.py`: this includes functions for preprocessing tree data, such as cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the data for biomass estimation models.
- `/notebooks`:
    - `kriging.ipynb`: this is a notebook that visualizes the data in a forest and implements an ordinary kriging model to predict the DBH of trees in the forest.
- `/tests`:
    - This folder contains unittests for our biomass calculations.

## Usage

The top-level interface for biomass prediction is the `combined_agb_calculator`, which operates on local JSON files.

```
from forest_carbon import combined_agb_calculator

# Path to the data to be augmented
PATH_TO_DATA = "./example_data/10_trees.json"

# Path to where the file should be saved
SAVE_PATH = "./example_data/10_trees_processed.json"

# Run the model
combined_agb_calculator.run_model(PATH_TO_DATA, SAVE_PATH)
```

This function expects JSON data of the form:
```
{
  "trees": [
    {
      "dbh": 0.16906605877647657,
      "species": "Oaks",
      "x_pos": 0.2879578776742475,
      "y_pos": 7.066390144590228
    },
    {
      "dbh": 0.1927687677079502,
      "species": "Ash",
      "x_pos": 2.3008407158621336,
      "y_pos": 5.588349266368208
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

and it will save a new JSON file with the same information plus the `AGB value` field containing the estimated aboveground biomass in kg.

The `combined_agb_calculator.run_model` handles pre-processing the tree data and running the AGB prediction model (automatically choosing the best empirical model given the available information about the tree). Lower-level interfaces are available for both the pre-processing (`combined_agb_calculator.load_tree_data_from_json`) and model evaluation steps (`combined_agb_calculator.apply_model`).
